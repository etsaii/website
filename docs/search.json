Since analysis for the Men’s game is widely available and well documented, I’ve applied some of the most popular methodologies to basic team stats for the Women’s game to better understand how strongly corralated the four factors are with the teams simple rating system, measure the offsive and defensive efficiency of each team, and visualize the strengths (and weaknesses) of each team. Let’s dive in!"

    "section": "Four Factors of Basketball",
    "text": "Four Factors of Basketball\nThe Four Factors designed by Dean Oliver in “Basketball on Paper” is considered the moneyball of Basketball to measure a team’s success. While these stats can be found calculated in Sports Reference’s Advanced School Stats, we’ll calculated them to see how they correlate with the teams simple rating system then use the four factors to measure the offensive and defensive efficiency of each team.\nThese four factors are:\nShooting the ball well measured by effective Field Goal % (eFG%)\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate both offensive and defensive effective field goal percentage\nteam_stats['Calc_Off_eFG%'] = (team_stats['Team_FG'] + 0.5 * team_stats['Team_3P']) / team_stats['Team_FGA']\nteam_stats['Calc_Def_eFG%'] = (team_stats['Opponent_FG'] + 0.5 * team_stats['Opponent_3P']) / team_stats['Opponent_FGA']\n\n\nThe effective field goal % captures the teams ability to shoot the ball. Because at the end of the game, the team with the most points wins. This is calculated as Field Goals Made + 0.5 * 3-pointers Made) / Field Goals Attempted. Unlike FG%, this calculation adds 50% more credit for 3-pointers made, since they are worth more points.\n** Avoiding turnovers - Turnover % **\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate Pace or Possessions\nteam_stats['Pace'] = team_stats['Team_FGA'] - team_stats['Team_ORB'] + team_stats['Team_TOV'] + (0.475 * team_stats['Team_FTA'] )\n\n# Calculate Turnover %\nteam_stats['Calc_Off_TOV%'] = team_stats['Team_TOV'] / team_stats['Pace']\nteam_stats['Calc_Def_TOV%'] = team_stats['Opponent_TOV'] / team_stats['Pace']\n\n\nGiving the ball away too often is a surefire way to lose a game. What percentage of possessions end in a turnover?\nTurnover % = Turnovers / Possessions\nSecond changes to score: Offensive rebound % \n\n\nCode\n# Create the defensive rebound column\nteam_stats['Team_DRB'] = team_stats['Team_TRB'] - team_stats['Team_ORB']\nteam_stats['Opponent_DRB'] = team_stats['Opponent_TRB'] - team_stats['Opponent_ORB']\n\n# Calculate offensive rebound %\nteam_stats['Calc_ORB%'] = team_stats['Team_ORB'] / (team_stats['Team_ORB'] + team_stats['Opponent_DRB'])\nteam_stats['Calc_Opp_ORB%'] = team_stats['Opponent_ORB'] / (team_stats['Opponent_ORB'] + team_stats['Team_DRB'])\n\n\nOffensive rebounds are a second change at scoring. So of the total rebounds happening while a team is on offense, how many are the offensive team getting them.\nOffensive Rebounding % = Offensive Rebounds / (Offensive Rebounds + Opponent’s Defensive Rebounds)\nGetting to the foul line: Free throw rate\n\n\nCode\nteam_stats['Calc_Off_FTR'] = team_stats['Team_FTA'] / team_stats['Team_FGA']\nteam_stats['Calc_Def_FTR'] = team_stats['Opponent_FTA'] / team_stats['Opponent_FGA']\n\n\nFree throws are yet another attempt to score. So getting fouled\nFree Throw Rate = Free Throws Attempts / Field Goal Attempts\n\nRelationship of Four Factors with Overall SRS\nOnce each of these metrics has been calculated, let’s evaulate the impact each metric has on the overall simple rating system of the team.\n\n\nCode\n# Set up the figure with four subplots\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 10))  # 2x2 grid\n\noff_four_factors = team_stats[['School', 'Overall_SRS', 'Calc_Off_eFG%', 'Calc_ORB%', 'Calc_Off_TOV%', 'Calc_Off_FTR']]\n\n# List of offensive factors\noffensive_factors = ['Calc_Off_eFG%', 'Calc_ORB%', 'Calc_Off_TOV%', 'Calc_Off_FTR']\n\n# Loop through the factors and plot each one against 'Overall_SRS'\nfor ax, factor in zip(axes.flatten(), offensive_factors):\n    sns.regplot(\n        data=off_four_factors,\n        x=factor,\n        y='Overall_SRS',\n        ax=ax,\n        scatter_kws={'s': 10},\n        line_kws={'color': 'red', 'linewidth': 0.8}\n    )\n    ax.set_title(f'Relationship between {factor} and Overall_SRS')\n\nplt.suptitle('Impact of Offensive Four Factors on Overall SRS', y=1.02)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Set up the figure with four subplots\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 10))  # 2x2 grid\n\ndef_four_factors = team_stats[['School', 'Overall_SRS', 'Calc_Def_eFG%', 'Calc_Opp_ORB%', 'Calc_Def_TOV%', 'Calc_Def_FTR']]\n\n# List of defensive factors\ndefensive_factors = ['Calc_Def_eFG%', 'Calc_Opp_ORB%', 'Calc_Def_TOV%', 'Calc_Def_FTR']\n\n# Loop through the factors and plot each one against 'Overall_SRS'\nfor ax, factor in zip(axes.flatten(), defensive_factors):\n    sns.regplot(\n        data=def_four_factors,\n        x=factor,\n        y='Overall_SRS',\n        ax=ax,\n        scatter_kws={'s': 10},\n        line_kws={'color': 'red', 'linewidth': 0.8}\n    )\n    ax.set_title(f'Relationship between {factor} and Overall_SRS')\n\nplt.suptitle('Impact of Defensive Four Factors on Overall SRS', y=1.02)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn all calculations, I use per game average since as a basketball fan, it allows me to reason about the data and catch mistakes easier. For example, if free throw attemps is 78, I’m able to recognize and issue witih my data. To increase accuracy calculations could be done on a per game basis before averaged out.\nSources: https://kenpom.com/blog/four-factors/"

    "text": "What a year 2025 has been! A year of many firsts and we’re so grateful to have settled quite well into our “new” lives now.\nAt the end of 2024, we moved into our new home in Brooklyn. It was a long drawn our process because of the back and forths with DOB and general hiccups of construction which took up much of Elaine’s time at the beginning of the year. However we’re loving our new home near Prospect Park and the space we have to host all our friends and family. If you ever find yourself in New York and would like to spend some time in a quieter more family friendly neighborhood be sure to let us know!\nFor the sweetest birthday present, Liam joined our family (on Brandon’s birthday and the day before Elaine’s). He was a bit reluctent to enter the world, but it seems he’s changed his mind and quite likes hanging out with us now! He’s already taken after Elaine in being quite loud and vocal about his opinions and after Brandon in his content to independently focus on hard problems like how to get the rattle in his mouth. We appreciate the adventurous eater that he’s becoming and his taste of music (he easily calms down to Pink Pony Club and Bob Seger. We’ve had so much fun taking him glamping in the Catskills (he loves a good campfire), many many walks and hikes (he also loves a good carrier nap) and are excited to be taking him on more adventures in 2026.\nBrandon continues to be heads down grinding away at Empirical Health as Elaine explores new daily routines with Liam, cooking and going on outings, (unless forced we are not stay-at-home people).\nGoing into 2026, we’re looking forward to be taking Liam on more trips and getting back into our active lives. Here are some things we already have planned. If any of this interests you or you have tips and advice, let us know! Our music shows & events lineup is also available here, if you’re in the NYC join us.\n\nEDC Vegas and GovBall (Saturday)\nPortland Maine: An annual family tradition where we partake in great seafood, beer, and the smell of the salty ocean.\nDiplo 5K: This was one of our favorite events this year, a fairly relax run with a dance party all before lunch! It’s likely in October in Flushing Meadows.\nNYRR 6 Virtual Races: Gonna put that jogging stroller to use so we can do the Brooklyn Half in 2027.\n\nHighlights of 2026: - Best bites: Radio Bakery Foccacia Sandwiches and 2-sheet Lasana at Rolos - Best music show: Anyma at Sphere - Most eventful vacation: Taking Brandon’s mom to Vegas to see Garth Brooks, followed by seeing Anyma at the Sphere with our friends."
