    "text": "March Madness is nearly upon us! Before filling out my beloved bracket, I wanted to dig into the data to better understand how Women’s College Basketball teams perform. Unlike Men’s College Basketball though, statistical analysis on the Women’s game is sparse. This created a great opportunity to dig into the data.\nSince analysis for the Men’s game is widely available and well documented, I applied some of the most popular methodologies to basic team stats for the Women’s game. In this article, I’ll focus on calculating: 1. Pace 2. Four Factors 3. Offensive and Defensive ratings\nWith these stats, we’re can go into March Madness better understanding the strengths of teams, predict the win probability of matchups, and identify the games that might be most exciting.\nThe data used here comes from Sports Reference. While some of the data we be calculating could be pulled directly from Sports Reference’s Advance Stats, we still calculate each stats since some of the method may deviate slightly.\nIn many of the analysis, we’ll also compare Sports Reference’s Simple Rating System (SRS) with the stats that we calculate. The Overall SRS, “takes into account average point differential and strength of schedule”, where zero is average and a high positive number signals a strong team.\n\nPace / Possessions\nLet’s start off by calculating “Pace”. Pace is the number of possessions the team has over the course of the game. Teams with more possession generally like to play with a faster paced game where the ball is changes hands more often and there’s more movement up and down the court.\nPace is calculated as:\nField Goal Attempts - Offensive Rebound + Turnovers + 0.475 * Free Throw Attempts\nOther formulas for calculating pace may use a different free throw multiplier. I’ve chosen to use the method by KenPom, one of leaders in Men’s college basketball analysis.\nThe average pace for all Women’s D1 College teams is 70.97.\n\n\n\nPasted image 20240321154820.png\n\n\nFor reference, the Men’s College average pace is generally the same at around 70 per 40 min[^1], while the WNBA average pace is 82.2 per 40 min period[^2] and the NBA average pace is 99.3 per 40 min period[^3].\nThe correlation between Pace and the Overall SRS of a team is very slight slope indicating that teams with higher overall SRS will on average potentially push the game to include a few more possessions.\n\n\n\nPasted image 20240321155153.png\n\n\nWe’ll later use pace to estimate the number of possessions in a game which when used with offensive and defensive rating can help us predict the win % of a game.\nNext, let’s calculate Dean Oliver’s four factor of basketball success. Dean Oliver’s book “Basketball on Paper” has been equated to as the moneyball of Basketball. He summarizes the success of a team based on shooting the ball well, avoiding turnovers, getting second chances to score the ball with offensive rebounds, and getting to the foul line.\nTo calculate each of these factors, I’ll again use KenPom’s formula’s. For simplicity, we also use the average per game stats across the entire season.\n\n\nShooting\nFor shooting, we’ll calcuate the effective field goal percentage (eFG%). The eFG% weights 3 pointers made 50% more than other field goals made. (Field Goals Made + 0.5 * 3-pointers Made) / Field Goals Attempted\n\n\n\nPasted image 20240322115305.png\n\n\nWith the shooting prodigy of Caitlin Clark, it’s no suprise that Iowa currently has highest effective field goal percentage. Not only are they ranked 1st for 3 points made but they’re also ranked 2nd for field goals made.\nInterestingly, UConn a “small’ team with an average height of 6ft currently, (when we account for only their active and not injuried players), has both a relatively high effective field goal % but also they’re opponents seem to have a harder time shooting against them compared to other great shooting teams. This just adds to the many reason why I’m extremely excited to see a UConn/Iowa matchup in the Final Four.\nWhen we plot the strengths of the team against their eFG%, we see a strong correlation between great teams and their ability to shoot the ball. \n\n\nRebounding\nOn the offensive rebound end, we’ll first need to calculate the opponent’s defensive rebound since that’s a rebound made by the opponent when the team was on offense. To calculate the offensive rebound %, we’ll use the formula: Offensive Rebounds / (Offensive Rebounds + Opponent’s Defensive Rebounds)\nUnlike other calculated stats that are labelled with a “off” for offense and “def” for defense, I’ve label offensive rebounds when the team is on defense as “Opponent Offensive Rebound %” to minimize any confusion.\n\n\n\nPasted image 20240322170814.png\n\n\nLouisiana State (LSU) leads this stat which should be no surprise since Angel Reese is currently the 2nd leading rebounder and she favors the inside shot. Lauren Betts (UCLA) and Kamilla Cardoso (USC), both 6’ 7” inside the paint shooters also help explain UCLA and USC showing on this list. What was interesting though is that although Stanford is ranked 7th in total rebounds they are ranked only 12th for offensive rebound %. My hunch is that since Cameron Brink has such a great outside shot, she’s not around to assist with the offensive rebounds.\n\n\nTurnovers & Free Throws\nLastly, we have turnover % is measured by Turnovers / Possessions, keep in mind that pace is the average number of possessions per game.\n\n\n\nPasted image 20240322171633.png\n\n\nAnd free throw rates, which is the number of times the team gets to the free throw line measured as Free Throws Attempts / Field Goal Attempts.\n\n\n\nPasted image 20240322171714.png\n\n\n\n\nRelationship of Four Factors\nOnce we have all four factors calculated, both for offense and defense, we can see how each factor impacts their SRS rating.\n\n\n\nPasted image 20240322172021.png\n\n\nWhat we can see here is that there’s a very strong correlation between highly rated teams and their offensive effective field goal %, great teams have a high percentage of effective field goals. There’s also correlation between highly rated teams with a low turnover %, great teams hold on to the ball. The relationship between offensive rebound % and offensive free throw rates appear to be there but might not make as much of a difference though.\nThe story on the defensive four factor side is a bit harder to decipher. While we can see. that better teams will limit their opponents field goals and their opponent’s ability to grab offensive rebounds turnover % and free throw rates appear a bit more scattered.\n\n\n\nPasted image 20240322172918.png\n\n\nWith the four factors, we can calculate the offensive and defensive efficiency of the teams. The offensive and defensive efficiency tell us the number of points scored or allowed per 100 possessions.\nThere are multiple ways to derive the offensive and defensive efficiency of a team based on the four factors. While Kenpom doesn’t publish the regression he uses, I was able to find CBB Analytic’s model.[^5]\nPredicted Offensive/Defensive efficiency = 32.333 + 1.55*eFG% + 0.47*ORB% - 1.55*TOV% + 0.19*FTA Rate\nThis model was likely built using only data from the Men’s Basketball game so we know there’s some margin of error introduced. In the future, I hope to validate the accuracy of this regression and derive our own regression based previous game data. However for now we just plugged in our values to get an initial offensive and defensive efficiency.\nBy plotting these values on to 4 quandrants that are split based on the median offensive and defensive efficiency, we can see an overview of the teams with the strongest offense and defense.\n\n\n\nPasted image 20240322174452.png\n\n\nFor the purpose of this chart, I’ve chosen to only display the top 20% of teams based on their Overall SRS. However, since March Maddess selection is not based on Overall SRS, not all teams playing in March Madness is on this chart and not all teams on this chart are playing in March Maddess.\nAnd there you have it, an introduction to some of the teams playing over the next few weeks. March Madness can be madness though and anything could happen.\nThis statistical analysis was all done in Google Colab located here, if you are interested in digging in and playing around with it yourself.\n[^1] https://kenpom.com/blog/national-efficiency/ [^2] https://herhoopstats.com/stats/wnba/league/ [^3] https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced?dir=-1&sort=PACE&PerMode=Per40 [^4] https://kenpom.com/blog/four-factors/ [^5] https://thepowerrank.com/cbb-analytics/"

    "text": "Four Factors of Basketball\nThe Four Factors designed by Dean Oliver in “Basketball on Paper” is considered the moneyball of Basketball to measure a team’s success. While these stats can be found calculated in Sports Reference’s Advanced School Stats, we’ll calculated them to see how they correlate with the teams simple rating system then use the four factors to measure the offensive and defensive efficiency of each team.\nThese four factors are:\nShooting the ball well measured by effective Field Goal % (eFG%)\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate both offensive and defensive effective field goal percentage\nteam_stats['Calc_Off_eFG%'] = (team_stats['Team_FG'] + 0.5 * team_stats['Team_3P']) / team_stats['Team_FGA']\nteam_stats['Calc_Def_eFG%'] = (team_stats['Opponent_FG'] + 0.5 * team_stats['Opponent_3P']) / team_stats['Opponent_FGA']\n\n\nThe effective field goal % captures the teams ability to shoot the ball. Because at the end of the game, the team with the most points wins. This is calculated as Field Goals Made + 0.5 * 3-pointers Made) / Field Goals Attempted. Unlike FG%, this calculation adds 50% more credit for 3-pointers made, since they are worth more points.\n** Avoiding turnovers - Turnover % **\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate Pace or Possessions\nteam_stats['Pace'] = team_stats['Team_FGA'] - team_stats['Team_ORB'] + team_stats['Team_TOV'] + (0.475 * team_stats['Team_FTA'] )\n\n# Calculate Turnover %\nteam_stats['Calc_Off_TOV%'] = team_stats['Team_TOV'] / team_stats['Pace']\nteam_stats['Calc_Def_TOV%'] = team_stats['Opponent_TOV'] / team_stats['Pace']\n\n\nGiving the ball away too often is a surefire way to lose a game. What percentage of possessions end in a turnover?\nTurnover % = Turnovers / Possessions\nSecond changes to score: Offensive rebound % \n\n\nCode\n# Create the defensive rebound column\nteam_stats['Team_DRB'] = team_stats['Team_TRB'] - team_stats['Team_ORB']\nteam_stats['Opponent_DRB'] = team_stats['Opponent_TRB'] - team_stats['Opponent_ORB']\n\n# Calculate offensive rebound %\nteam_stats['Calc_ORB%'] = team_stats['Team_ORB'] / (team_stats['Team_ORB'] + team_stats['Opponent_DRB'])\nteam_stats['Calc_Opp_ORB%'] = team_stats['Opponent_ORB'] / (team_stats['Opponent_ORB'] + team_stats['Team_DRB'])\n\n\nOffensive rebounds are a second change at scoring. So of the total rebounds happening while a team is on offense, how many are the offensive team getting them.\nOffensive Rebounding % = Offensive Rebounds / (Offensive Rebounds + Opponent’s Defensive Rebounds)\nGetting to the foul line: Free throw rate\n\n\nCode\nteam_stats['Calc_Off_FTR'] = team_stats['Team_FTA'] / team_stats['Team_FGA']\nteam_stats['Calc_Def_FTR'] = team_stats['Opponent_FTA'] / team_stats['Opponent_FGA']\n\n\nFree throws are yet another attempt to score. So getting fouled\nFree Throw Rate = Free Throws Attempts / Field Goal Attempts\n\nRelationship of Four Factors with Overall SRS\nOnce each of these metrics has been calculated, let’s evaulate the impact each metric has on the overall simple rating system of the team.\n\n\nCode\n# Set up the figure with four subplots\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 10))  # 2x2 grid\n\noff_four_factors = team_stats[['School', 'Overall_SRS', 'Calc_Off_eFG%', 'Calc_ORB%', 'Calc_Off_TOV%', 'Calc_Off_FTR']]\n\n# List of offensive factors\noffensive_factors = ['Calc_Off_eFG%', 'Calc_ORB%', 'Calc_Off_TOV%', 'Calc_Off_FTR']\n\n# Loop through the factors and plot each one against 'Overall_SRS'\nfor ax, factor in zip(axes.flatten(), offensive_factors):\n    sns.regplot(\n        data=off_four_factors,\n        x=factor,\n        y='Overall_SRS',\n        ax=ax,\n        scatter_kws={'s': 10},\n        line_kws={'color': 'red', 'linewidth': 0.8}\n    )\n    ax.set_title(f'Relationship between {factor} and Overall_SRS')\n\nplt.suptitle('Impact of Offensive Four Factors on Overall SRS', y=1.02)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Set up the figure with four subplots\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 10))  # 2x2 grid\n\ndef_four_factors = team_stats[['School', 'Overall_SRS', 'Calc_Def_eFG%', 'Calc_Opp_ORB%', 'Calc_Def_TOV%', 'Calc_Def_FTR']]\n\n# List of defensive factors\ndefensive_factors = ['Calc_Def_eFG%', 'Calc_Opp_ORB%', 'Calc_Def_TOV%', 'Calc_Def_FTR']\n\n# Loop through the factors and plot each one against 'Overall_SRS'\nfor ax, factor in zip(axes.flatten(), defensive_factors):\n    sns.regplot(\n        data=def_four_factors,\n        x=factor,\n        y='Overall_SRS',\n        ax=ax,\n        scatter_kws={'s': 10},\n        line_kws={'color': 'red', 'linewidth': 0.8}\n    )\n    ax.set_title(f'Relationship between {factor} and Overall_SRS')\n\nplt.suptitle('Impact of Defensive Four Factors on Overall SRS', y=1.02)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn all calculations, I use per game average since as a basketball fan, it allows me to reason about the data and catch mistakes easier. For example, if free throw attemps is 78, I’m able to recognize and issue witih my data. To increase accuracy calculations could be done on a per game basis before averaged out.\nSources: https://kenpom.com/blog/four-factors/"

The Overall SRS, “takes into account average point differential and strength of schedule”, where zero is average and a high positive number signals a strong team.\nData Sources: Sports Reference: https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/seasons/women/2024-ratings.html Massey Rating: https://masseyratings.com/cbw/ncaa-d1/ratings Sokol’s LRMC ratings: https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jsokol/lrmcW/ Moore’s ratings: https://sonnymoorepowerratings.com/w-basket.htm"
