2025 was year of many firsts. We're so grateful to have settled quite well into our "new" routines now.

At the end of 2024, we moved into our new home in Brooklyn. It was a long drawn our process due to the back and forths with DOB and general hiccups of construction. However we're loving our new home near Prospect Park and the space we have to host all our friends and family. If you ever find yourself in New York and would like to spend some time in a quieter more family friendly neighborhood be sure to let us know!

For the sweetest birthday present, Liam joined our family (on Brandon's birthday and the day before Elaine's). He was a bit reluctent to enter the world, but it seems he's changed his mind and quite likes hanging out with us now! He's already taken after Elaine in being quite vocal about his opinions and after Brandon in his content to independently focus on hard problems like how to get the rattle in his mouth. We appreciate the adventurous eater that he's become and his taste of music (he easily calms down to Pink Pony Club and Bob Seger). 

In anticipation of Liam joining the family and worried we might be tied down with a newborn, we went yolo on our adventures going to Spain, Vegas, and roadtripping from Sedona to SLC (an area of the country we absoutely love). The first few months as a family of 3 was certainly difficult, however we feel we very much turned the corner after taking him glamping in the Catskills (he loves a good campfire) and have gotten him accustom to our many many walks and hikes (he also loves a good carrier nap).

Brandon continues to be changing heart health at Empirical Health. And Elaine explores new daily routines with Liam, cooking and going on outings, while vibe coding during his naps.

Going into 2026, we're looking forward to be taking Liam on more trips and showing him our favorite hobbies & activities. Here are some things we already have planned. If any of this interests you or you have tips and advice, let us know! 

- EDC Vegas and GovBall(Saturday)
- Portland Maine: An annual family tradition where we partake in great seafood, beer, and the smell of the salty ocean.
- Diplo 5K: This was one of our favorite events this year, a fairly relax run with a dance party all before lunch! It's likely in October in Flushing Meadows.
- NYRR 6 Virtual Races: Gonna put that jogging stroller to use so we can do the Brooklyn Half in 2027.

Our music shows & events lineup is also available here, if you're in the NYC join us.
