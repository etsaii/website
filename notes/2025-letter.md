What a year 2025 has been! A year of many firsts and we're so grateful to have settled quite well into our "new" lives now.

At the end of 2024, we moved into our new home in Brooklyn. It was a long drawn our process because of the back and forths with DOB and general hiccups of construction which took up much of Elaine's time at the beginning of the year. However we're loving our new home near Prospect Park and the space we have to host all our friends and family. If you ever find yourself in New York and would like to spend some time in a quieter more family friendly neighborhood be sure to let us know!

For the sweetest birthday present, Liam joined our family (on Brandon's birthday and the day before Elaine's). He was a bit reluctent to enter the world, but it seems he's changed his mind and quite likes hanging out with us now! He's already taken after Elaine in being quite loud and vocal about his opinions and after Brandon in his content to independently focus on hard problems like how to get the rattle in his mouth. We appreciate the adventurous eater that he's becoming and his taste of music (he easily calms down to Pink Pony Club and Bob Seger. We've had so much fun taking him glamping in the Catskills (he loves a good campfire), many many walks and hikes (he also loves a good carrier nap) and are excited to be taking him on more adventures in 2026. 

Brandon continues to be heads down grinding away at Empirical Health as Elaine explores new daily routines with Liam, cooking and going on outings, (unless forced we are not stay-at-home people).

Going into 2026, we're looking forward to be taking Liam on more trips and getting back into our active lives. Here are some things we already have planned. If any of this interests you or you have tips and advice, let us know! Our music shows & events lineup is also available here, if you're in the NYC join us.

- EDC Vegas and GovBall (Saturday)
- Portland Maine: An annual family tradition where we partake in great seafood, beer, and the smell of the salty ocean.
- Diplo 5K: This was one of our favorite events this year, a fairly relax run with a dance party all before lunch! It's likely in October in Flushing Meadows.
- NYRR 6 Virtual Races: Gonna put that jogging stroller to use so we can do the Brooklyn Half in 2027.

Highlights of 2026:
- Best bites: Radio Bakery Foccacia Sandwiches and 2-sheet Lasana at Rolos
- Best music show: Anyma at Sphere
- Most eventful vacation: Taking Brandon's mom to Vegas to see Garth Brooks, followed by seeing Anyma at the Sphere with our friends.
