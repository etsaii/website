As a new parent in Brooklyn, I got tired of tracking Baby and Me activities across different sites then forgetting about them. To solve this, I built **BK Baby and Me** a single-page React app that displays all the weekly activities in one clean, filterable view. Then allows me to export the events to iCal for easy calendar integration.
