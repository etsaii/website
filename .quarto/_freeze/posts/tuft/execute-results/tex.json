The Tufte handout style is a style that Edward Tufte uses in his books and handouts. Tufte's style is known for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set typography. Quarto[^1] supports most of the layout techniques that are used in the Tufte handout style for both HTML and LaTeX/PDF output.\n\n[^1]: To learn more, you can read more about [Quarto](https://www.quarto.org) or visit [Quarto's Github repository](https://www.github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli).\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-margin execution_count=1}\n```` { .cell-code}\n```{{python}}\n#| fig-cap-location: margin\n#| fig-cap: \"A figure with a longer caption.
