Tufte’s style is known for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set typography. Quarto1 supports most of the layout techniques that are used in the Tufte handout style for both HTML and LaTeX/PDF output.\n1 To learn more, you can read more about Quarto or visit Quarto’s Github repository.\n```{python}\n#| fig-cap-location: margin\n#| fig-cap: \"A figure with a longer caption.

    "section": "Four Factors of Basketball",
    "text": "Four Factors of Basketball\nFrom a data analysis perspective, the four factors of success in basketball boils down to:\n\nShooting the ball well: Effective Field Goal % (eFG%)\nAvoiding turnovers: Turnover %\nSecond changes to score: Offensive rebound %\nGetting to the foul line: Free throw rate\n\nWhile these stats can be found calculated in Sports Reference’s Advanced School Stats, I’ve chosen to calculated them myself.\nIn order for us to measure the offensive and defensive efficiency of each team, we’ll first calculate these stats for each team, this is their offense. For defense, we’ll calculate how well their opponents do in each of these stats when playing against them.\n\nEffective Field Goal % (eFG%) {#sec-eFG%}\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate both offensive and defensive effective field goal percentage\nteam_stats['Calc_Off_eFG%'] = (team_stats['Team_FG'] + 0.5 * team_stats['Team_3P']) / team_stats['Team_FGA']\nteam_stats['Calc_Def_eFG%'] = (team_stats['Opponent_FG'] + 0.5 * team_stats['Opponent_3P']) / team_stats['Opponent_FGA']\n\n\nThe effective field goal % captures the teams ability to shoot the ball. Because at the end of the game, the team with the most points wins. If you’re not scoring, you can’t win. This is calculated as Field Goals Made + 0.5 * 3-pointers Made) / Field Goals Attempted. Unlike FG%, this calculation adds 50% more credit for 3-pointers made, since they are worth more points.\n\n\nOffensive Rebound % {#sec-off-reb%}\n\n\nCode\n# Create the defensive rebound column\nteam_stats['Team_DRB'] = team_stats['Team_TRB'] - team_stats['Team_ORB']\nteam_stats['Opponent_DRB'] = team_stats['Opponent_TRB'] - team_stats['Opponent_ORB']\n\n# Calculate offensive rebound %\nteam_stats['Calc_ORB%'] = team_stats['Team_ORB'] / (team_stats['Team_ORB'] + team_stats['Opponent_DRB'])\nteam_stats['Calc_Opp_ORB%'] = team_stats['Opponent_ORB'] / (team_stats['Opponent_ORB'] + team_stats['Team_DRB'])\n\n\nOffensive Rebounding % = Offensive Rebounds / (Offensive Rebounds + Opponent’s Defensive Rebounds)\n\n\nTurnover % {#sec-turnover%}\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate Pace or Possessions\nteam_stats['Pace'] = team_stats['Team_FGA'] - team_stats['Team_ORB'] + team_stats['Team_TOV'] + (0.475 * team_stats['Team_FTA'] )\n\n# Calculate Turnover %\nteam_stats['Calc_Off_TOV%'] = team_stats['Team_TOV'] / team_stats['Pace']\nteam_stats['Calc_Def_TOV%'] = team_stats['Opponent_TOV'] / team_stats['Pace']\n\n\nTurnover % = Turnovers / Possessions\n\n\nFree Throw Rate\n\n\nCode\nteam_stats['Calc_Off_FTR'] = team_stats['Team_FTA'] / team_stats['Team_FGA']\nteam_stats['Calc_Def_FTR'] = team_stats['Opponent_FTA'] / team_stats['Opponent_FGA']\n\n\nFree Throw Rate = Free Throws Attempts / Field Goal Attempts\n\n\nRelationship of Four Factors with Overall SRS\nOnce each of these metrics has been calculated, let’s evaulate the impact each metric has on the overall simple rating system of the team.\n\n\nCode\n# Set up the figure with four subplots\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 10))  # 2x2 grid\n\noff_four_factors = team_stats[['School', 'Overall_SRS', 'Calc_Off_eFG%', 'Calc_ORB%', 'Calc_Off_TOV%', 'Calc_Off_FTR']]\n\n# List of offensive factors\noffensive_factors = ['Calc_Off_eFG%', 'Calc_ORB%', 'Calc_Off_TOV%', 'Calc_Off_FTR']\n\n# Loop through the factors and plot each one against 'Overall_SRS'\nfor ax, factor in zip(axes.flatten(), offensive_factors):\n    sns.regplot(\n        data=off_four_factors,\n        x=factor,\n        y='Overall_SRS',\n        ax=ax,\n        scatter_kws={'s': 10},\n        line_kws={'color': 'red', 'linewidth': 0.8}\n    )\n    ax.set_title(f'Relationship between {factor} and Overall_SRS')\n\nplt.suptitle('Impact of Offensive Four Factors on Overall SRS', y=1.02)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Set up the figure with four subplots\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 10))  # 2x2 grid\n\ndef_four_factors = team_stats[['School', 'Overall_SRS', 'Calc_Def_eFG%', 'Calc_Opp_ORB%', 'Calc_Def_TOV%', 'Calc_Def_FTR']]\n\n# List of defensive factors\ndefensive_factors = ['Calc_Def_eFG%', 'Calc_Opp_ORB%', 'Calc_Def_TOV%', 'Calc_Def_FTR']\n\n# Loop through the factors and plot each one against 'Overall_SRS'\nfor ax, factor in zip(axes.flatten(), defensive_factors):\n    sns.regplot(\n        data=def_four_factors,\n        x=factor,\n        y='Overall_SRS',\n        ax=ax,\n        scatter_kws={'s': 10},\n        line_kws={'color': 'red', 'linewidth': 0.8}\n    )\n    ax.set_title(f'Relationship between {factor} and Overall_SRS')\n\nplt.suptitle('Impact of Defensive Four Factors on Overall SRS', y=1.02)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn all calculations, I use per game average since as a basketball fan, it allows me to reason about the data and catch mistakes easier. For example, if free throw attemps is 78, I’m able to recognize and issue witih my data. To increase accuracy calculations could be done on a per game basis before averaged out.\nSources: https://kenpom.com/blog/four-factors/"

    "text": "Anticipate, anticipate, anticipate As a ballperson, we need to act quickly and make sure the balls are on the correct side of the court and immediately available for the players. We’re taught to anticipate our next move so that once the play is over we’re ready. Just like how a 2nd baseman needs to be prepared to turn 2, our reaction cannot interupt the flow of the game and is therefore a part of the game.\nSet yourself up and start moving as soon as the ball is hit, movement\n\nPickleball can be a game of quickness. By having your hands up and your body ready to react, it’s much easier to get at any quick balls that might be coming your way.\nI noticed that tennis players were always on their feet ready to return that 100+mph serve. While the pickleball is not moving as fast, same should be done by a pickleball player.\n\nDiscuss strategy and communicate to your partner\n\nTennis pros will signal with their partner at every point, I go here and you go here. They have a plan for how they’ll act their opponent. Each team will play different depending on their strengths.\nThe same should be done in pickleball, are you planning on driving more or dropping more? Was the drop good and your partner should move in, or should they move back and be prepared to defend.\n\nGoal should be to win, not to hit the hardest\n\nOften I find that pickleball players enjoy hitting the shit out of the ball more than winning. What I appreciated about watching tons of tennis is that you see players of heights and sizes compete. Placement of the ball can be a key to a winning match."
