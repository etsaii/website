Previously a startup product manager at Twilio, Postmates, and RevOps. Now a full-time mom, writing and vibe-coding one nap at a time.

I seek experiences that are novel, challenging, and fun - from shipping innovative tech products to working as a Ballperson at the US Open. I'm driven by curiosity, motivated by action, and have an ever-growing list of ideas and dreams. 

I'm a New Yorker at heart, raised as an American expat in Taipei, Taiwan. Currently, I reside in Brooklyn, NY.
